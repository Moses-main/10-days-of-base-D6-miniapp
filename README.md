## Customization

### Update Manifest Configuration

The `minikit.config.ts` file configures your manifest located at `app/.well-known/farcaster.json`.

**Skip the `accountAssociation` object for now.**

To personalize your app, change the `name`, `subtitle`, and `description` fields and add images to your `/public` folder. Then update their URLs in the file.

## Deployment

### 1. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
vercel --prod
```

You should have a URL deployed to a domain similar to: `https://your-vercel-project-name.vercel.app/`

### 2. Update environment variables

Add your production URL to your local `.env` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_NAME="Your App Name"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=<Replace-WITH-YOUR-CDP-API-KEY>
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-vercel-project-name.vercel.app/
```

### 3. Upload environment variables to Vercel

Add environment variables to your production environment:

```bash
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_NAME production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_URL production
```

## Account Association

### 1. Sign Your Manifest

1. Navigate to [Farcaster Manifest tool](https://farcaster.xyz/~/developers/mini-apps/manifest)
2. Paste your domain in the form field (ex: your-vercel-project-name.vercel.app)
3. Click the `Generate account association` button and follow the on-screen instructions for signing with your Farcaster wallet
4. Copy the `accountAssociation` object

### 2. Update Configuration

Update your `minikit.config.ts` file to include the `accountAssociation` object:

```ts
export const minikitConfig = {
    accountAssociation: {
        "header": "your-header-here",
        "payload": "your-payload-here",
        "signature": "your-signature-here"
    },
    frame: {
        // ... rest of your frame configuration
    },
}
```

### 3. Deploy Updates

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Testing and Publishing

### 1. Preview Your App

Go to [base.dev/preview](https://base.dev/preview) to validate your app:

1. Add your app URL to view the embeds and click the launch button to verify the app launches as expected
2. Use the "Account association" tab to verify the association credentials were created correctly
3. Use the "Metadata" tab to see the metadata added from the manifest and identify any missing fields

### 2. Publish to Base App

To publish your app, create a post in the Base app with your app's URL.
